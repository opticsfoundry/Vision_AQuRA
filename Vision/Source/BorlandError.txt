stan, i got this of the borland site a while ago...

Steps to resolve table overflow errors:

1) Linker produces error like "Fatal: block overflow for browsercache"
2) In the current directory ( EXE target directory ) there will now
be file name TLINK32.INI containing the default sizes of all the
internal linker tables.
3) In the INI file, look up the BrowserCache entry and increase it,
for example, changing it from 0x200 to 0x220.
4) Now re-link the application.
5) If you get the same or a similar error again, continue increasing
the
appropriate table entry in the INI file and re-linking until the
error
is resolved.

IMPORTANT: Memory usage has been tuned with these table sizes.
It is recommended being very conservative when increasing this value
to avoid significant degradation in link time. If the default for
a table is 0x200, try 0x220 first. Keep upping this value until it
works.

This only works for the 32 bit linker. Both the command line and the
integrated linker support the .INI file.
